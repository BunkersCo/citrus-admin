<h3>Connector Library</h3>

<p>The Citrus admin connector is a little helper library that provides detailed information during the test run by pushing events to the admin UI.
    The citrus-admin-connector is part of the Citrus project and is automatically loaded when tests are run. The connector library registers special
    test listeners and pushes information to the citrus-admin web application. This way the admin UI is able to display runtime information of the
    tests such as exchanged messages, test results and so on.</p>

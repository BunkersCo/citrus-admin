## Installation

The Citrus administration UI is a web application that uses Spring boot and Angular2. First of all download the latest distribution which
is a Java JAR file located at [labs.consol.de/maven/repository](https://labs.consol.de/maven/repository/com/consol/citrus/citrus-admin-web):

Save the Java archive to a folder on your local machine and start the Spring boot web application. The downloaded JAR should be executable 
from command line like this:

```java -jar citrus-admin-web-1.0.0-beta-5.war```

You will see the application starting up. Usually you will see some console log output. The web server should start within seconds. Once the application is up and running
you can open your browser and point to 'http://localhost:8080'.
 
That's it you are ready to use the Citrus administration UI. Next thing to do is to [open a project](project-open.md).

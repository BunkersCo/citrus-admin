## Test design

The next feature is quite experimental. In the test design view Citrus tries to give you a graphical representation of the test actions in your test. Each test action
is displayed as a graphical node. If you enter the action with the mouse or if you click on a test action node some more details are displayed.

**NOTE:** The test design view is not complete for all test actions. Some actions may not be displayed or may have limited display.

## Preconditions

The administration UI is in early beta status and still under construction. Following from that we have to deal with some limitations and
trade offs until the final version is published. 

At the moment we are limited to supporting standard Citrus projects using Maven, 
TestNG or JUnit and Java 7 or higher. Gradle or ANT projects are currently not supported.
 
Your project should use Citrus version 2.0 or higher in order to be able to work with the administration UI. Earlier Citrus versions might work too but are
not tested and will not get support with bugfixes.

## Project management

The basic objective of the administration UI is to manage your Citrus projects. The UI is able to open your project in order
to view and edit your project configuration as well as your test cases.

You can do the following things regarding project management

* [New project](project-new.md): Creates a nee Citrus project from scratch.
* [Open project](project-open.md): Opens an existing Citrus project.
* [Dashboard](project-dashboard.md): Shows all project related information such as test count, latest test run, configuration and so on.
* [Settings](project-settings.md): Show and edit project settings such as folder layout, build types and versions.
* [Statistics](project-statistics.md): Shows common project statistics.

[[project]]
= Project

The basic objective of the administration UI is to manage your Citrus projects. The UI is able to open projects in order
to view and edit your project configuration and test cases. Usually the projects are located somewhere on your local machine so
the UI can open those projects from local file system. In addition to that the UI is able to load project sources from git repositories. As an alternative
you can create completely new projects from Maven archetypes. The following sections walk through all these options in more detail.

[[project-dashboard]]
== Dashboard

The dashboard gives you a quick overview of what your project looks like. Citrus reads information about your project such as
name, package, description, test count, latest reports and so on.

The project dashboard is a good starting point to discover your project with all link:#project-settings[projects settings] and link:#tests[tests].

[[project-settings]]
== Settings

Each Citrus project has properties and settings that influence the administration UI. These properties are project names, descriptions, versions and source folders.
You can review and change these project related settings with an HTML form on the project settings page.

Some project settings are read only at the moment, e.g. we do not support renaming of projects yet. If you want to rename a project or change the project version you need to do this manually
in the Maven POM configuration for now.

If you save the project settings the administration UI will save the changes to the project settings file *citrus-project.json* which is located in your project home directory. This file uses the Json syntax and looks like follows:

[source,json]
----
{
   "projectHome" : "~/Projects/Citrus/citrus-sample",
   "name" : "citrus-sample-project",
   "description" : "",
   "version" : "1.0.0",
   "settings" : {
     "basePackage" : "com.consol.citrus",
     "citrusVersion" : "2.6",
     "springApplicationContext" : "src/it/resources/citrus-context.xml",
     "javaSrcDirectory" : "src/test/java/",
     "xmlSrcDirectory" : "src/test/resources/",
     "javaFilePattern" : "/**/*Test.java,/**/*IT.java",
     "xmlFilePattern" : "/**/*Test.xml,/**/*IT.xml",
     "useConnector" : true,
     "build" : {
       "@class" : "com.consol.citrus.admin.model.build.maven.MavenBuildConfiguration",
       "type" : "maven",
       "properties" : [ ],
       "testPlugin" : "maven-failsafe",
       "clean" : false,
       "compile" : true,
       "command" : null,
       "profiles" : null
     }
   }
}
----

This project Json file is automatically created whenever the admin UI opens a project on your local file system. This file should be part of your coder versioning platform in order to save settings related to that project. When the project is reopened
the UI will read project settings from that file in order to make sure that the project is loaded with the exact same settings as in the past. So you can also adjust this file manually in order to manipulate the way the UI is opening your project.

[[project-settings-general]]
=== General

Each Citrus project works with Java classes and resources. These files are located in project folders inside the Maven project. Citrus admin is working with these defaults:

* src/test/java/ folder for Java test classes
* src/test/resources/ folder for test resources (e.g. configuration files)
* /\\**/*Test.java,/**/*IT.java file pattern for Java test classes
* /\\**/*Test.xml,/**/*IT.xml file pattern for XML test cases

You can customize these settings according to your project setup.

[[project-settings-build]]
=== Build configuration

The administration web UI is able to execute tests. This test execution is done by calling the Maven build lifecylce for the opened project. You can adjust
the build settings accordingly. By default Citrus admin uses the *maven-failsafe* to execute the Citrus tests. This causes Citrus to call

[source,bash]
----
mvn compile integration-test
----

This executes all Citrus test cases. You can change this to *maven-surefire* so the Maven command looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
mvn compile test
----

In case you need to activate Maven profiles during the build you need to add those profiles to the build settings. Each profile name that you save
to the build settings will result in some command line argument for the Maven build like this:

[source,bash]
----
mvn compile integration-test -PmyProfile
----

Also when some system properties should be set during the Maven build you can add those properties to the build settings, too.
This results in command line arguments for the Maven command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn compile integration-test -DmyProperty=value
----

This is how to customize the Maven build that executes the Citrus tests in a project.

*NOTE: As you can see we are not speaking about Gradle build configuration here. This is simply because it is not possible to manage Gradle projects at the moment!
Stay tuned for future releases to come*

[[project-settings-modules]]
=== Modules

Citrus as a framework is modular. You can add and remove Citrus capabilities by adding and removing module dependencies in your project. Usually
these Citrus modules are managed as Maven dependencies in your project. The Citrus administration UI is able to manage these dependencies for you.

image:screenshots/project-modules.png[Project modules]

On the modules settings page you see all currently activated modules. And you get a list of available modules that you can add. Just check or uncheck the
modules and the administration UI will automatically add/remove Maven dependencies in your project.

*NOTE: This mechanism does not work with Gradle projects. Yet this is a feature to come soon hopefully!*

[[project-settings-connector]]
=== Admin connector

In the previous chapter we have seen how to customize the project and build settings for the active project. Now when
the administration UI executes some Citrus tests we can make use of a special connector library that provides detailed
information about the test run and its outcome.

Basically this little helper library provides detailed information during the test run by pushing events to the admin UI.

image:screenshots/project-connector.png[Connector library]

The connector library is available from Maven central and is simply added as dependency to the target project. You can use the
admin UI settings page for automatically adding this little helper to the target project. The automated connector setting will
place the new Maven dependency to the project POM and add special test listeners to the Spring application context in your Citrus project.

Here is the connector Maven dependency that is added to the target project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.consol.citrus</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-admin-connector</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.admin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Once this library is present for your project you can configure the special connector test listeners as Spring beans:

[source,xml]
----
<bean class="com.consol.citrus.admin.connector.WebSocketPushEventListener">
  <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
  <property name="port" value="8080"/>
</bean>
----

As you can see the connector is pushing message data to the administration UI using a WebSocket API on the administration UI server. The _host_ and _port_ properties are customizable, default values are _localhost_ and _8080_. When a test is executed
the message listener will automatically connect and push messages exchanged to the administration UI.

Of course the administration UI server has to be accessible during the test run. The message listener will automatically test the server connectivity at the beginning of the test run. In case the administration UI is not accessible the message push
feature is simply disabled. So you can continue to work with your Citrus project even if the administration UI is not started.

The connector will provide lots of valuable information about the running tests when activated. This is how the administration UI is able to track messages exchanged during a test run for instance. Stay tuned for more features related to the test
execution and message exchange.

This way the admin UI is able to display runtime information of the tests such as exchanged messages, test results and so on.

As mentioned before you can automatically activate/deactivate the connector library in the project settings. Just explore the setting page for details.
This will automatically add or remove the citrus-admin-connector Maven dependency for you.

*NOTE: This mechanism does not work with Gradle projects. Yet this is a feature to come soon hopefully!*

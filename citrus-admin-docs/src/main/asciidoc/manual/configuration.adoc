[[configuration]]
= Configuration

The Citrus components such as endpoints, variables, functions, schemas and dictionaries are configured in a Spring application context.
The administration UI is able to read and change the Citrus components configuration. Each component category is represented with a separate page
in the configuration section.

[[config-endpoints]]
== Endpoint configuration

Endpoints are essential in a Citrus project. They define client and server components as well as producer and consumer for different message transports.

image:screenshots/config-endpoints.png[Endpoints]

First of all the list of all available endpoints in the project is displayed. Each endpoint represents a message transport such as SOAP, JMS, REST, Mail, FTP and so on.
You can add new endpoints using the _New_ context menu on the right. You need to chose the endpoint type first. Then a HTML form is displayed holding the endpoint settings.

Click save to add the new endpoint. Citrus is working with Spring XML configuration files. This means that the new endpoint component is saved as XML Spring bean to the basic
Spring application context file. Usually this is a file located in _src/test/resources/citrus-context.xml_ in your project. After you have saved the new component you will see that a new
entry has been added to this file.

You can also edit endpoint components in the administration UI. Just click an an existing endpoint component and you will see the HTML form with all the settings to this endpoint.

If you save the changes Citrus will again change the Spring bean component in the XML configuration file. You can manually review the changes made. All manual changes in the Spring application context
will also affect the administration UI. Just hit the reload button in your browser to reload the configuration.

[[config-application-context]]
== Spring application context

Citrus uses the Spring framework for dependency injection and component configuration. Usually a Citrus project comes with a set of Spring configuration files that define Citrus components and other
project related settings. The admin UI scanns the project sources for typical Spring configuration files and displays all components (Spring beans) in that configuraiton.

You can review the beans with all properties and you can edit the Spring configuration files.

[[config-global-variables]]
== Global Variables

Test variables represent a common concept in Citrus. Variables define reusable identifiers and values that are referenced multiple times in a test case. The global variables are visible
to all Citrus test cases and represent static constant values valid for the whole project. The global variables are editable via HTML forms on the configuration page:

image:screenshots/config-global-variables.png[Global variables]

The variables are saved to the Spring bean configuration as Citrus *global-variables* component:

[source,xml]
----
<citrus:global-variables>
    <citrus:variable name="projectName" value="Citrus Integration Testing"/>
    <citrus:variable name="userName" value="TestUser"/>
</citrus:global-variables>
----

[[config-schemas]]
== Schema Repositories

Every time Citrus receives a message over some kind of messaging transport the validation mechanism will try to validate the syntax of the message payload with some
schema rules. When using XML payloads these are XSD or WSDL files that define the syntax rules. In Citrus you can define schema repositories that hold one to many XML
schema definition files. The Citrus XML message validators consult these schema repositories during message validation for matching schema definitions.

The schema repositories and schema definition files are managed on configuration page.

The configuration made here is saved to the Spring bean configuration files as Citrus schema components.

[[config-namespace]]
== Namespace Context

When using Xpath expressions in Citrus XML namespaces may be required to identify elements and attributes in XML payloads. The XML namespaces used in Xpath
are identified with a prefix that evaluates to a target namespace value. You can define all namespaces and prefix values globally using the namespace context configuration.

The namespace context configuration is save as Citrus Spring bean component in the application context.

[source,xml]
----
<citrus:namespace-context>
    <citrus:namespace prefix="hello" uri="http://citrusframework.org/schemas/samples/HelloService.xsd"/>
</citrus:namespace-context>
----

[[config-dictionaries]]
== Data Dictionaries

Data dictionaries help to define reusable expressions that manipulate message payloads before a message is sent or received. Usually these are Xpath or JsonPath expressions
that overwrite values in message payloads throughout the whole project. Each message payload will consult the data dictionary for translation of values before being sent or received.

This way you can add centralized expressions that overwrite message payload elements in multiple test cases.

The data dictionary configuration is done on the configuration pages.

[[config-functions]]
== Functions

Functions apply on message payloads and test variables for dynamic value generation. The functions can be used in multiple places throughout the Citrus framework (e.g. payload, header, variables, etc.)
Each function is provided with parameters and generates a String value as outcome. This way the user can place functions in order to generate more dynamic test data for instance. There are lots of predefined
functions ready for usage in Citrus (e.g. citrus:randomUUID(), citrus:currentDate() and many more).

In addition to that you can create custom functions that implement very specific algorithms matching your very specific project needs. These functions and its implementations are configured here:

[[config-matcher]]
== Validation Matcher

Similar to adding custom functions in Citrus you can also add custom validation matcher implementations. The matcher helpers do implement specific validation logic that applies to message
validation when receiving messages in Citrus. There are lots of predefined matchers available in Citrus (e.g. @contains()@, @equalsIgnoreCase()@ and many more).

Custom validation matchers are configurable via HTML forms on the configuration pages.
